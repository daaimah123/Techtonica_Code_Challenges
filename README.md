## 🎦 Recorded Interviews
Weeks 1 - 9, you will screen record a single code-challenge in addition to your Yoodli core skills review. That’s two recordings each week! You will receive feedback at the beginning of the following week.

💡Mondays will be used to review recording feedback
Each Wednesday you will record your core skills interview and add it into your “Feedback” sheet. Mondays will be used to review the feedback of your recorded session from the previous week. Consider and rework your answers to incorporate any actionable changes.
