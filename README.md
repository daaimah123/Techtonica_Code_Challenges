You will be provided a prompted code-challenge. Work on it for 20 minutes! Your code challenge block will be used to go over any questions you may have.  Every week you will [screen record](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWUXCqAlOBhyhp5Mg5bkB-78O64tPztU5miDOMQ_unM/edit?usp=sharing) a single code-challenge in addition to your [Yoodli](https://yoodli.ai/) core skills review. That’s two recordings each week! You will receive feedback at the beginning of the following week.

🎗️ **Reminder:** any stated challenges in your code problems should be after-thoughts - you can begin to apply the challenge once you’ve already solved the main challenge objective(s).

### 🎦 Recorded Interviews (Weeks 1 - 8)
Each Wednesday you will record your code challenge and core skills interviews, and add it into your “Growth Feedback” sheet. That’s two recordings each week! You will receive feedback at the beginning of the following week.

### 💡 Mondays will be used to review feedback
Mondays will be used to review the feedback of your recorded session from the previous week. Consider and rework your answers to incorporate any actionable changes.
